<p>Kubernetes has its virtues and <a class="reference external" href="https://srcco.de/posts/why-kubernetes.html">is worth investing
in</a>, but it is
undoubtedly complex and comes with many operational challenges.
We faced many of them on our journey towards &quot;cloud native&quot; at Zalando.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>We constantly learned from other organizations that shared their failures
and insights, so I <a class="reference external" href="https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-failure-stories.html">started to compile a list of public failure/horror
stories related to
Kubernetes</a>.
The goal was to make it easier for people tasked with operations to find
outage reports to learn from.</p>
<p>Many of these failures had a few things in common. Here are the factors
that contributed to failure.</p>
<section id="missing-operational-maturity">
<h1>Missing Operational Maturity</h1>
<p>Infrastructure operations is a challenge for most organizations and the
transformation towards end-to-end responsibility (&quot;DevOps&quot;, &quot;you build
it, you run it&quot;) is often in full swing. Smaller organizations usually
use a tool to bootstrap a cluster (e.g.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops">kops</a>), but do not dedicate
time to set up full continuous delivery for the infrastructure. This
leads to painful manual Kubernetes upgrades, untested infrastructure
changes, and brittle clusters. The same situation applies to managed
infrastructure, as cloud offerings never come with all batteries
included. Infrastructure changes should get at least the same attention
and rigor as your customer-facing app deployments. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
</section>
<section id="upstream-kubernetes-docker-issues">
<h1>Upstream Kubernetes/Docker issues</h1>
<p>Some of the failures can be attributed to upstream issues, e.g. Docker
daemon hanging, issues with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48638">kubelet not reconnecting to the control
plane</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">Kernel CPU throttling
bugs</a>, unsafe
CronJob defaults, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/73587">kubelet memory
leaks</a>.</p>
<p>If you hit an upstream issue—congratulations! You can follow or file an
upstream issue and hope or contribute a fix helping many others. I would
expect this class of failure causes to get smaller over time as CNCF
projects mature and the user base grows, making it less probable that
you will be the first to hit an upstream issue.</p>
</section>
<section id="cloud-organization-integrations">
<h1>Cloud/organization Integrations</h1>
<p>Kubernetes comes in more than one flavor: There are many possible
combinations of Kubernetes components and configurations. Kubernetes
needs to interact with your cloud platform, such as Google Cloud or AWS,
and your existing IT landscape. And all of these integrations can lead
to failure scenarios.</p>
<p>We saw Kubernetes' AWS cloud provider code easily hit AWS API rate
limits and have problems with EBS persistent volume attachments. Using
the AWS ELB with dynamic IPs caused problems with kubelet losing
connections. The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rn-v2TNH9k4Oz-VuaueP77ANE5p-5Ua89obK2JaArfg/edit">AWS IAM integration
(kube2iam)</a>
is notoriously prone to race conditions.</p>
</section>
<section id="human-error">
<h1>Human Error</h1>
<p>Let us be clear: There is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXXaCCbpNYw">no such thing as &quot;human error&quot; as a root
cause</a>. If your Root
Case Analysis (RCA) concludes with &quot;human error&quot;, start over and ask
some hard questions.</p>
</section>
<section id="share-your-learnings">
<h1>Share your learnings</h1>
<p>Nowadays everybody is talking about &quot;failure culture,&quot; but what
organization is truly ready to share its failures and learnings
publicly? Kubernetes gives us a common ground where we can all benefit
from sharing our experiences and learnings from each other.</p>
<p>Many contributing factors are not new, such as the maturity in
infrastructure changes, Docker, distributed systems, and so on. But
Kubernetes gives us a common language to talk through and address them.
By reducing the unknown unknowns of operating or using Kubernetes
through shared experiences, it will get easier for everyone over time.</p>
