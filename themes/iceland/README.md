Iceland Nikola Theme
====================

This theme is closely based on the Nikola built-in bootstrap4 theme.
It customizes some of the page layouts, particularly the blog index (list of posts).
I used some style cues (fonts) from the [start bootstrap agency template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/).

I was lazy and put some content-specific styling in `assets/css/theme.css`,
so if you want to use the theme (please do), I'd recommend copying this directory and
modifying as needed. See my `conf.py` for configuration.
